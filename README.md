### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Uses correct HTML structure for application. Two HTML pages. One for login and one for voting. Hyperlinks to choice artifact.
- **CSS** - Application styling that looks good on different screen sizes, uses good whitespace, color choice and contrast.
- **React** - Provides login, choice display, applying votes, display other users votes, and use of React for routing and components.
- **Service** - Backend service with endpoints for:
  - login
  - retrieving choices
  - submitting votes
  - retrieving vote status
- **DB/Login** - Store users, choices, and votes in database. Register and login users. Credentials securely stored in database. Can't vote unless authenticated.
- **WebSocket** - As each user votes, their votes are broadcast to all other users.

- [x] **Backend listens for WebSocket connection** - done!
- [x] **Frontend makes WebSocket connection** - done!
- [x] **Data sent over WebSocket connection** - done!
- [x] **WebSocket data displayed** - All user votes display in realtime. I'm really proud that this is working. Way cool!
